                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Concept</h2>
                    <p class="section-content-large">Miasma explores the invisible forces that shape and transform our environment, drawing inspiration from historical theories of disease transmission and Jeff VanderMeer's "Annihilation"—where an alien presence known as the Shimmer gradually mutates and reconfigures all biological matter within its boundaries.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Challenge</h2>
                    <p class="section-content-large">How do we visualize the unseen atmospheric forces—pollution, contamination, transformation—that continuously reshape our world? How can 3D rendering capture the slow, creeping change that occurs beneath our perception?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Solution</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">A 3D visualization created in Blender that renders atmospheric contamination as living, evolving forms. Using procedural modeling techniques, geometry nodes, and particle systems, the piece translates invisible pollutants into organic structures that mutate, spread, and transform. Like the Shimmer in Annihilation, the visualization creates a space where the familiar becomes strange, where invisible contamination becomes hauntingly visible.</p>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Conceptual Framework</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The term "miasma" originates from the Greek word for pollution or stain, historically referring to noxious vapors believed to cause disease. Before germ theory, people understood illness through this invisible atmospheric presence—something felt but not seen, present but not understood.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">In VanderMeer's Annihilation, the Shimmer operates as a modern miasma: a transformative force that refuses to be understood through conventional scientific frameworks. It mutates DNA, hybridizes species, and rewrites the fundamental code of life itself. The novel's protagonist ventures into this contaminated zone, only to find herself gradually becoming part of its transformation.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">This 3D visualization creates a similar space of transformation. The rendered forms manifest the invisible as visible, translating abstract concepts of contamination into evolving biological structures. The boundaries between organic and inorganic, natural and synthetic, dissolve into patterns of continuous mutation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Visual Language</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The visualization's aesthetic draws from organic growth patterns, bacterial colonies, and crystalline structures. Procedurally generated forms emerge and evolve—like the gradual encroachment of the Shimmer. Geometry nodes drive continuous mutation, causing forms to proliferate, hybridize, and consume the 3D space.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Color palettes evoke contamination and decay: particulate matter manifests in deep violets and toxic greens, atmospheric disturbances pulse with thermal reds and blues, while chemical pollutants create iridescent, oil-slick patterns rendered through complex shader networks.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2 class="section-label">Rendering & Technique</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">Unlike traditional scientific visualizations that maintain clinical distance, Miasma creates an immersive visual experience that draws viewers into the contamination itself. The 3D space becomes a living organism—forms breathe, grow, and decay through procedural animation and physics simulations.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">The piece unfolds cinematically, with the camera moving through evolving landscapes of mutation. Patterns emerge and transform gradually—like the expedition in Annihilation, understanding requires sustained viewing, observation, and acceptance of fundamental strangeness. Volumetric lighting and atmospheric effects enhance the sense of navigating through a contaminated zone.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-label">Impact & Reflection</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">Miasma makes visible the slow violence of environmental contamination. In an era of climate change, air pollution, and ecological collapse, we exist within our own Shimmer—a zone of gradual transformation that we struggle to perceive or comprehend. By translating invisible atmospheric forces into visceral, evolving 3D forms, the visualization creates a visual meditation on our entanglement with environmental forces beyond our control.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Like VanderMeer's novel, the work resists simple interpretation or resolution. It offers no solutions, only presence—an invitation to witness transformation, to sit with uncertainty, to recognize ourselves as part of larger ecological systems that mutate and evolve regardless of human intention.</p>
