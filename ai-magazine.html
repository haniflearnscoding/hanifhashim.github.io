                    <p class="section-content-large">A critical visual essay examining the politics of artificial intelligence—how AI companies and governments manipulate, control, and puppeteer different models to serve power structures rather than public interest.</p>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Challenge</h2>
                    <p class="section-content-large">How do you visualize invisible systems of control? How can editorial design reveal the hidden politics behind supposedly neutral AI technologies?</p>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Solution</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">A magazine format that uses visual form to expose the mechanisms of AI manipulation. Through layout, typography, and imagery, the piece deconstructs how corporations and state actors shape AI systems to reflect their interests—from training data bias to algorithmic censorship, from surveillance capitalism to automated propaganda.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-label">Visual Approach</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The magazine uses visual form as argument. Layout choices mirror the content's critical stance: fragmented grids suggest fractured truth, overlapping elements reveal hidden layers of control, and typography shifts between clinical corporate language and urgent activist messaging.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Imagery juxtaposes the sterile aesthetics of tech marketing with the messy reality of political manipulation. The design refuses to present AI as neutral infrastructure—instead, it visually argues that every model, every dataset, every deployment embeds power relations.</p>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Critical Perspective</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">This project challenges the dominant narrative of AI as inevitable progress. Instead, it examines who benefits from AI systems, whose voices are amplified or silenced, and how technological power concentrates in the hands of corporations and states.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">The magazine explores specific mechanisms of control: how training data reflects existing inequalities, how content moderation policies enforce corporate values, how government contracts direct AI research toward surveillance and warfare, and how the promise of "democratized AI" masks concentration of power.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Design Process</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The editorial design process involved researching AI politics literature, analyzing tech company PR materials for their visual language, and experimenting with layouts that could communicate complex power dynamics.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Typography became a tool for revealing contradiction—placing corporate mission statements against evidence of harmful practices, setting algorithmic outputs beside the biased training data that produced them. The grid system intentionally breaks and reforms, suggesting both rigid corporate control and its potential disruption.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Research & Context</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The project draws on critical AI studies, examining how models reflect the political and economic interests of their creators. It investigates training data as political choices, algorithmic decision-making as encoded ideology, and the infrastructure of AI development as sites of power concentration.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Questions explored include: Who decides what AI systems optimize for? How do content moderation policies serve corporate interests disguised as community standards? What happens when state surveillance merges with commercial data collection? How does the AI industry manufacture consent for increasing automation and control?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-label">Reflection</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">This magazine argues that AI is fundamentally political—every technical decision embeds values, serves interests, and distributes power. By making these dynamics visible through design, the project contributes to broader conversations about technology, democracy, and justice.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">The challenge of visualizing AI politics lies in making abstract systems concrete. Through editorial design, the magazine translates complex power relations into accessible visual arguments, inviting readers to question who controls AI and to whose benefit it operates.</p>
