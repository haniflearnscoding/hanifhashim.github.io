                    <h2 class="section-label">About Sly Cooper 3</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">Sly Cooper 3: Honor Among Thieves (2005) is a beloved PlayStation 2 stealth platformer developed by Sucker Punch Productions. The Venice safehouse serves as the crew's headquarters during the Italian heist operation—a richly detailed interior space filled with ornate furniture, artwork, and period details that establish the game's charming art-deco-meets-cartoon-noir aesthetic.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">This environment represents a technical achievement for PS2 hardware: multiple light sources, reflective surfaces, detailed textures, and atmospheric depth all running on 32MB of RAM. Recreating it in Unreal Engine pays homage to this technical artistry while exploring what these spaces might look like with modern rendering capabilities.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Lighting & Atmosphere</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The scene captures the Venice apartment's signature moody atmosphere: warm spotlight illuminating the golden throne-like chair, purple and burgundy upholstery catching volumetric light, rich wood paneling, and dramatic curtains framing the space. Unreal Engine's real-time lighting allows for dynamic shadows and bounce light that enhance the depth and warmth of the original design.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Careful attention was paid to preserving the stylized, slightly exaggerated proportions and color choices of the original while taking advantage of modern techniques like screen-space reflections, ambient occlusion, and volumetric fog to add richness without losing the game's distinctive visual character.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Asset Extraction Workflow</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The extraction process involved running Sly Cooper 3 through a PS2 emulator with debugging tools enabled, allowing access to the game's memory and file structure. Textures were exported from the game's proprietary TIM2 format, while models required parsing custom geometry formats used by Sucker Punch's engine.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Many PS2-era models used vertex colors and simple UV mapping optimized for the console's limited texture memory. These techniques needed translation into modern PBR material workflows, creating base color, roughness, and normal maps that respect the original aesthetic while taking advantage of Unreal's material system.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-label">Preservation & Nostalgia</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">This project explores game preservation through technical reconstruction. As original PS2 hardware ages and becomes less accessible, extracting and recreating these environments ensures they can be experienced by future audiences. The Venice apartment represents countless hours players spent between heists, planning missions, and enjoying character interactions—it's a space rich with nostalgia and emotional significance.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">By bringing this environment into Unreal Engine, the project also opens possibilities for interactive experiences, VR exploration, or further artistic reinterpretation while maintaining a connection to the source material.</p>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Technical Challenges</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">PS2 games used highly optimized, non-standard asset pipelines that don't map directly to modern engines. Texture compression, vertex color baking, and custom shader approximations all required manual interpretation and recreation. The original game ran at 512x448 resolution—translating these assets to 4K rendering revealed texture limitations that needed careful upscaling or recreation.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Lighting posed particular challenges: the PS2 version used pre-baked lightmaps and vertex lighting, while Unreal Engine uses real-time global illumination. Recreating the mood required studying the original lighting setup and translating it into dynamic light sources that capture the same atmosphere.</p>

                    <p class="section-content">This project sits at the intersection of technical art, game preservation, and nostalgia. It demonstrates skills in reverse engineering, asset pipeline development, and environment art while paying tribute to the craftsmanship of PS2-era game developers who created rich, memorable spaces within severe hardware constraints.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">The Venice apartment in Sly Cooper 3 represents a specific moment in game design history—before HD graphics, before PBR materials, when every texture and polygon had to be meticulously optimized. Recreating it in Unreal Engine bridges past and present, showing how these beloved spaces can evolve while retaining their essential character.</p>
