                    <p class="section-content">Graduate names are presented with appropriate formality, and scholarship information includes both recipient names and award amounts, ensuring transparency and proper recognition.

Section headings appear in a bold purple (matching the gradient theme), while body text uses neutral dark gray for optimal legibility. The cover typography is set in crisp white, creating strong contrast against the gradient background.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Special attention was paid to name presentation—all graduate and scholarship recipient names use consistent formatting to ensure equal prominence and respect for each individual's achievement.</p>
