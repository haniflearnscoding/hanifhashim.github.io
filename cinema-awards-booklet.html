                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Design Elements</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The cover features oversized outline typography reading "AWARDS CEREMONY 2023" overlaid on moody photography of students in a cinema production space, creating visual drama. The Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema wordmark appears prominently, with supporting text set in clean sans-serif typography for maximum legibility.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">The vibrant magenta serves multiple functions: it creates strong brand recognition, adds energy to the formal context, and provides excellent contrast for wayfinding elements like the "RECEPTION" callout box. The interior spreads balance dense text content with generous whitespace, ensuring the booklet remains approachable rather than overwhelming.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Content Organization</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The booklet systematically presents awards across three main program areas: Film Animation, Film Production, and Film Studies. Each section clearly identifies scholarship providers (Advisory Board, Sandra and Leo Kolber, Fondation de Sève) and individual award names, followed by recipient listings. Special recognition is given to major awards like the Mel Hoppenheim Award for Outstanding Overall Achievement in Film Production.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">Practical information—including reception details, venue directions, and school contact information—is integrated thoughtfully to ensure attendees have all necessary event logistics while maintaining the celebratory focus on student achievement.</p>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Typography & Layout</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The design employs a clear typographic hierarchy with bold headings for award categories, medium-weight subheads for scholarship names, and regular body text for recipient lists. Consistent formatting across all award entries creates rhythm and makes scanning for specific names effortless during the ceremony.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">The layout accommodates a substantial amount of text—dozens of awards and hundreds of names—without feeling cramped. Strategic use of bold weights, spacing, and alignment creates visual breathing room while ensuring every recipient receives appropriate recognition.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Print Specifications</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">The booklet was designed as a multi-page saddle-stitched document, allowing it to lay flat during the ceremony for easy reference. Careful attention to margins, gutters, and safe zones ensures text remains readable across the center spread. The design was prepared with proper bleed and trim specifications for professional printing, with colors matched to Concordia Fine Arts brand standards.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-section">
                    <h2 class="section-label">Impact & Context</h2>
                    <p class="section-content">This booklet serves as both functional event program and commemorative keepsake. For recipients, it's a tangible record of their achievement. For the school, it demonstrates the breadth and generosity of its scholarship programs and donor partnerships. The design needed to honor everyone equally while creating a cohesive, celebratory atmosphere.</p>
                    <p class="section-content">The Awards Ceremony recognizes excellence across diverse cinema disciplines—from experimental animation to documentary filmmaking to film theory—and the booklet's design reflects this creative diversity through bold visual choices that complement the school's innovative spirit.</p>
